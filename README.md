# React + Vite

This repo contains the code of the password generator ccreated by me during the learning process of teh REACT.js.
During this prroject creation I learnt effective and essential usecase of React states like useState,useRef,useCallBack.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
